Validation logic is handled at the application level.

To define this logic, we create a "Schema".

{red}1.{/red} Continue with your code from the last lesson
{red}2.{/red} Create a new Schema called {bold}Person{/bold}
{red}3.{/red} Add a field to {bold}Person{/bold} called {bold}name{/bold} that is a {bold}String{/bold} and is {bold}required{/bold}
{red}4.{/red} Add a field to {bold}Person{/bold} called {bold}score{/bold} that is a {bold}Number{/bold} and has a default value of {bold}0{/bold}
{red}5.{/red} Load the {bold}Person{/bold} Schema into mongoose using {bold}db.model{/bold}
{red}6.{/red} Remember to call {bold}process.exit(){/bold} when your program is finished!

The database is located at {bold}{green}mongodb://localhost:9001/workshop{/green}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
