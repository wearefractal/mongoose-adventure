I have inserted multiple {bold}Person{/bold} objects into the database with different names and scores.

{red}1.{/red} Continue with your code from the last lesson
{red}2.{/red} Use {bold}Person.find{/bold}, {bold}Person.sort{/bold}, and {bold}Person.limit{/bold} to find the top 3 people in the database sorted by score
{red}3.{/red} Log the {bold}name{/bold} attribute of the top 3 people in order (use one {bold}console.log{/bold} statement)
{red}4.{/red} Remember to call {bold}process.exit(){/bold} when your program is finished!

For this lesson I would like you to use the chainable Query object. You can find documentation at {bold}{green}http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html{/green}{/bold}

The database is located at {bold}{green}mongodb://localhost:9001/workshop{/green}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
