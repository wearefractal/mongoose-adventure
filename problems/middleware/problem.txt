I have inserted one {bold}Person{/bold} into the database with the {bold}name{/bold} set as {bold}Officer Bungus{/bold}

{red}1.{/red} Continue with your code from the last lesson
{red}2.{/red} Add a new field to the {bold}Person{/bold} Schema called {bold}lastModified{/bold} with the type of {bold}Date{/bold} and a default value of {bold}Date.now{/bold}
{red}3.{/red} Add a {bold}pre save{/bold} middleware function that sets {bold}lastModified{/bold} to {bold}Date.now(){/bold}
{red}4.{/red} When you get the result from the query, increase the {bold}score{/bold} attribute by 10
{red}5.{/red} Update the document in the database by calling {bold}save{/bold}
{red}6.{/red} Remember to call {bold}process.exit(){/bold} when your program is finished!

The database is located at {bold}{green}mongodb://localhost:9001/workshop{/green}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
