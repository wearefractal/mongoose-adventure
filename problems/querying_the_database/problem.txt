I have inserted one {bold}Person{/bold} into the database with the {bold}name{/bold} set as {bold}Officer Bungus{/bold}

{red}1.{/red} Use your code from the last lesson to start off
{red}2.{/red} Use {bold}Person.findOne{/bold} to find a single document from the database where the {bold}name{/bold} attribute matches
{red}3.{/red} Log the {bold}score{/bold} attribute of the person retrieved from the query
{red}4.{/red} Remember to call {bold}process.exit(){/bold} when your program is finished!

The database is located at {bold}{green}mongodb://localhost:9001/workshop{/green}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
